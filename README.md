**pnSelf**

 With pnSelf you can use features typically reserved for bots (sending embeds, 
spam filling channels etc). It is nowhere near complete at this point. I plan on adding many more features to it in the future but for now it allows users to
create custom embeds, spam channels, send disappearing messages, and send
clickable text that directs users to a user-specified url.

 To log into your user account with pnSelf, you will need to provide your account
token. If you dont know how to get your token, [here's a helpful guide](https://discordhelp.net/discord-token)

 Once you have successfully logged in with your account token, type !!help in any
channel and pnSelf will send an embed with a list of commands and how to use
them.
